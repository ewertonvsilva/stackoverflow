An approach you can take to solve this will filter the data you want directly in the query. 
 
#### Filtering from BigQuery:
First for a better understanding, take a look on the data schema for the fields that contains product names:
 
- The first possible field could be `hits.item.productName`
	- hits is a `RECORD`
    - item is a  `RECORD` inside item 
     - `productName` is the string `hits.item`
 
 - The second field could be  `hits.product.v2ProductName`
	 - product is a  `RECORD` inside item 
     - `v2ProductName` is the string `hits.product`
 
For query a `RECORD`, you have to 'flat' is, turning it into a table using the expression `UNNEST([record])`  as described [here](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/arrays#flattening_arrays):
 
So to return all the unique product names from `hits.product.v2ProductName` query :
 
```
 
from google.cloud import bigquery
import pandas as pd
client = bigquery.Client()
 
sql = """
SELECT
DISTINCT p.v2productname
FROM
`bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions_*`,
UNNEST(product) AS p
WHERE
date  BETWEEN  '20160101'
AND  '20161231'
AND (p.v2productname IS  NOT  NULL);
"""
v2productname = client.query(sql).to_dataframe()
print(v2productname)
```
For use the field `hits.item.productName` run the following, **but all records are `null`**:
 
```
SELECT
DISTINCT h.item.productname
FROM
`bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions_*`,
UNNEST(hits) AS h,
UNNEST(product) AS p
WHERE
date  BETWEEN  '20160101'
AND  '20161231'
AND (h.item.productname IS  NOT  NULL);
```
 
 
 
 
 
#### Filtering from the dataframe: 
I tried to process it using a dataframe but its not possible due to the chain of records in the datasets, the function `to_dataframe()` is not able to process it. 
 
#### In resume:
Try to filter and process as much of the data as possible in the BigQuery, it will faster and more cost effectively.
